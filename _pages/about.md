I am a data science intern at Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA), currently investigating the role of car clubs in transport sustainability. I'm particularly enthusiastic about visualising and presenting data in an informative way. 

My background is in maths and Fluid Dynamics, and I've recently completed a PhD at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Fluid Dynamics, University of Leeds. I developed a particle-based numerical model for simulating landslides (which often behave as fluids).  

I've recently gained an interest in the overlap between data analytic techniques (such as Machine Learning) and physical simulations.
